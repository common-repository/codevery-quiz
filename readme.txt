**SALE COUPON**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What type of question I can add? =

You can add questions with text or with image answers.

= How do users earn discount coupons? =

You can set a point threshold that, when reached, triggers the issuance of a discount coupon (the shortcode has to be add to 'Success description' in the settings). This incentivizes users to take the quiz and rewards those who perform well.

= How does the coupon work? =

Users who achieve a specified point threshold in the quiz become eligible to receive a coupon. The coupon functionality is integrated with WooCommerce, allowing users to use their coupons during checkout on your WooCommerce-powered online store. Once the user reaches the required points, the plugin automatically generates a unique coupon code, which can be applied in the coupon field on the WooCommerce checkout page.

Please note that the coupon functionality is designed to work exclusively with WooCommerce, ensuring a smooth and streamlined experience for your customers. And also the discount coupon shortcode should be added to the 'Success description' field in the plugin settings.
